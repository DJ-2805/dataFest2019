# DataFest 2019
This is our project for the DataFest competition at UCLA in 2019. We analyzed data from a women's rugby team, and more precisily looked on how games would affect the performance of each player. We created a model that looks at the tackles each player experienced during a game day and looked at how this would affect the player in training sessions after the tournament.
